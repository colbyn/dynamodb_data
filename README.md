Serde based serialization support and misc utilities for working with Dynamodb via the `rusoto_dynamodb` crate.

# Features:
* Automatically convert your types to/from `rusoto_dynamodb` data types VIA `serde_json`. This is an alternative to `serde_dynamodb` (which is mostly unimplemented).
* Query/Conversion Macros
